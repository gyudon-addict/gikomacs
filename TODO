what's next


gikopoi-gfx feature that displays the room and characters like proper gikopoi
- using emacs' svg and image features this will be possible, but likely slow
- development is ongoing

gikopoi-sfx feature to play sounds for join, mention, message, etc.

gikopoi-streams feature that lets you view and create audio and video streams
- there was a discussion on the emacs-devel mailing list for inclusion of a
  patch for a GStreamer xwidget, but it appears to have gotten nowhere and
  emacs usually isn't built with xwidgets anyway

- the most plausible solution seems to be some hack involving the gst-launch
  command to spawn GStreamer pipelines, which I could make emacs processes out
  of no problem; a possible downside may be that video streams won't be contained
  in an emacs window

gikopoi-tts feature that reads aloud messages with a TTS engine
- the question here is what TTS lib to actually use. Emacspeak is a complex
  interface for a speech environment which would probably do the job quite well,
  but is also likely overkill, and isn't distributed in any emacs package repos
  (although it does come with slackware and is in a lot of distro repos).
  I also haven't figured out how to set it up.

gikopoi-server feature that reimplements the gikopoi2 server in elisp
- how some of the more bespoke features like streams ought to be implemented is
  up for speculation. I consider it might be done simply as a process for a WebRTC
  server like janus or something, which is the server gikopoi2 uses, I think.

- there was the idea of building the chat on top of an IRC server, but it turns out
  that there are zero elisp IRC servers to be found!

- unlike gikopoi2, i'd like to encourage trying to interface with alternate clients;
  this doesn't mean the protocol is likely to be compatible, but more likely to be
  at least stable. A project I'd like to support somehow is to rip the client code
  from the gikopoi2 distribution and package it as it's own separate application.


some fun things like a mode for playing chess
